## Exercises to master Bootstrap
This repository is here to help you master Bootstrap, the CSS framework, by a really simple way; Reproduce the different models using Bootstrap. 

It includes different exercises. Each exercise is composed of 5 models. 

## How it works ? 
To start you will need to copy the model.html and model.css in your text editor, and save the files. The model.css doesn’t need to be changed, just to be saved on your computer. 

Be careful in the model.html on line 6 to change the path of the CSS stylesheet depending on where you saved the files, and how you named it. 

model.html is the template you will use to try to reproduce models of the exercise of your choice. 

Once you’re done, you can copy the code of the exercise you want to do, save it and open it on your browser. You will have to try to reproduce the models, of course without looking the code. 

Open your model.html in another window, fill it, and see if what you did corresponds to the model of the exercise, and go to the next one !

## More instructions
<b>For all the exercise, we do not use col-lg and col-xl</b>. 

Exercise 1 and 2 are the easiest exercises, and so they are not taking into consideration the responsivity; just make sure your window has at least a 768 pixels size (which is corresponding to col-md), and you’re good to go !

<b>But for exercise 3 and up, the exercises are responsive</b>. Make sure you reduce the size of your window to see the changes. You will see 3 changes, corresponding to col- (xs), col-sm and col-md. You will have to fill the template to make it identical to the model for every size of the screen. 

## Hint files
Each exercise contains a hint file (hint.txt). In this file you will find helpful link(s) to the Bootstrap documentation, to help you on the actual exercise.
